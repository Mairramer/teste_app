## About Project

I've been learning and always implementing flutter in my daily life as a student and programmer.
In this project some packages, such as:

[Get](https://pub.dev/packages/get): for route management.

[Modular Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular): to control dependency injections and divide screens into modules.

[Mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx): state management.

[intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl): to manage the format of currencies.

I also used firebase auth and firebase store.

Basta criar um projeto no Firebase e executar os testes
